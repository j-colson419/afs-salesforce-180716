                    <legend><a name="sandboxes">Sandboxes</a></legend>
                    <p>Sandboxes are isolated from your production org, so operations that you perform in your sandboxes don’t affect your production org.</p>
                    <h3>Sandbox Types</h3>
                    <h4>Developer Sandbox</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Developer sandbox is intended for development and testing in an isolated environment. A Developer Sandbox includes a copy of your production org’s configuration (metadata).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Developer Pro Sandbox</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Developer Pro sandbox is intended for development and testing in an isolated environment and can host larger data sets than a Developer sandbox. A Developer Pro sandbox includes a copy of your production org’s configuration (metadata). Use a Developer Pro sandbox to handle more development and quality assurance tasks and for integration testing or user training.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Partial Copy Sandbox</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Partial Copy sandbox is intended to be used as a testing environment. This environment includes a copy of your production org’s configuration (metadata) and a sample of your production org’s data as defined by a sandbox template. Use a Partial Copy sandbox for quality assurance tasks such as user acceptance testing, integration testing, and training.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Full Sandbox</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Full sandbox is intended to be used as a testing environment. Only Full sandboxes support performance testing, load testing, and staging. Full sandboxes are a replica of your production org, including all data, such as object records and attachments, and metadata. The length of the refresh interval makes it difficult to use Full sandboxes for development. <br>
                        We recommend that you apply a sandbox template so that your sandbox contains only the records that you need for testing or other tasks. <br>
                        When you create a Full sandbox, you also have to decide how much field tracking history and Chatter activity to include.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The default is to omit field tracking, but you can include up to 180 days of field tracking. If you track field history for many objects in your production org, specify fewer days to avoid generating an excessive amount of data.</li>
                            <li>Chatter activity data can be extensive, which can add a significant amount of time to your Full sandbox copy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Limit the amount of field history that you copy, and copy your Chatter data only if you need it for your testing use cases.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Full Sandboxes can be refreshed ONCE every 29 days
                            <ul>
                                <li>No exceptions to the 29 day rule – once refreshed, you cannot refresh again within the 29 day window</li>
                                <li>Plan ahead! Refresh your sandbox when it makes sense for the project (ie, immediately prior to beginning development or testing)</li>
                                <li>Use metadata migration tools (force.com IDE) and data migration tools (data loader, ETL) to migrate configuration and data inside a 29 day refresh window</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Developer and Developer Pro sandboxes can be refreshed once a day.</li>

                    <h3>Sandbox Refresh Duration</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sandbox refresh duration timeframes vary and cannot be guaranteed</li>
                        <li>Refresh times can take minutes, days, or even more than a week</li>
                        <li>All sandbox refresh requests are placed into a queue and will be processed on a first come first served basis.</li>
                        <li>There is no capability to modify the queue order so please ensure you have enough lead time for your refresh to be queued and then processed</li>
                        <li><b>Plan appropriately – do not wait until the last minute to request your full sandbox refresh if needed for a project initiative – expect this to take some time it may take several days depending upon the number of requests in the queue and the size of the data being copied</b></li>
                        <li> Full sandbox refreshes take the most amount of time, given that they are copying both full prod configuration AND data vs Developer Pro and Developer sandboxes which are only copying configuration metadata</li>
                        <li>The amount of data, custom objects, and code have an impact on sandbox refresh durations – ie, more data, more complex configuration = longer refresh cycles</li>

                    <h3>Make Changes Safely</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the power of Lightning Platform, your organization can run lean and clean. Keeping it lean means making smart customizations the right way, so you enjoy a tailor-made experience with easy maintenance. Keeping it clean means accurate data, so when the business asks, “How many customers bought more of my product this year?” you can trust the answer is right.<br>
                        To keep your organization lean and clean, use a consistent process of build, test, and deploy. People refer to this process as application lifecycle management or change management.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Build</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the appropriate environment, define functional requirements and develop your changes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Test</h4>
                    <p>
                        Test your changes. Testing verifies that the changes behave as you expect, and don’t deliver any undesired side-effects. Then, test the changes on a small set of experienced people who can give you feedback (user acceptance testing).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Deploy</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once testing is successfully completed, make your changes available in production. Training people about the changes is a best practice.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What's Safe to Change in Production?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can develop new functionality in a production organization. However, untested customizations can create a mess in production by deleting data or even worse. Customizations that don’t affect data are safe to do in a production organization, such as developing new dashboards, reports, and email templates.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What can happen if you don’t test changes before making them available in production?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A workflow rule or trigger accidentally creates an infinite processing loop.</li>
                        <li>A logic error in a validation rule that means you can never save a record.</li>
                        <li>Page layout changes confuse people instead of improving their experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>A typical development lifecycle for customizations in a production organization can provide some protection:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create functional requirements.</li>
                        <li>Develop and test changes using the Salesforce user interface. Create profiles to hide your changes until they’re fully tested.</li>
                        <li>Update profiles to reveal your changes to the appropriate users.</li>
                        <li>Notify people about the changes.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The safest way to customize your organization is to make and test changes in a copy of your organization, called a sandbox. Build and test changes before deploying to production. In fact, some changes must be done in a sandbox. For example, you can’t write Apex code directly in a production organization.

                        custom object and custom field, the related component and page layout
                        will both be listed.</li>
